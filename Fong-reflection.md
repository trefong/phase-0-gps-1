#Fong Reflection
1.What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Prior to the GPS session I was struggling with what the add action actually does. I learned that it allows you to pick your changes that you want to include in your commit.

2.What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concept of git add was clarified as well as pushing up to GitHub.

3.What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my partner what add actually did and both my partner and the guide helped me through the process.

4.What still confuses you about git?
Something that still confuses me about git is when I should delete the branch.

5.How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I'm glad to say that I enjoyed my first pairing. I really liked being able to think through things with another person, since up until this point I had to do it all by myself. I also liked that if we started doing something wrong, there was someone there that could immediately answer our questions.
