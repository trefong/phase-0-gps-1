# Bill's Reflections

#### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I have a pretty good understanding of the git concepts we've been using recently 
so I didn't really struggle with any of them prior to the GPS session.

#### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
`git add` and how it relates to the overall git flow was discussed in good details. 
Also I find that going back to watch DBC's git videos again (after using git/github 
for a while) really helps reinforce the understanding of the whole git flow.
  
#### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
The GPS was collaborative, fun and interactive. There were times I felt like I talked 
too much so I always tried to get my pair and sometimes our guide (Charlotte) for 
their inputs too. 

#### What still confuses you about git?
Based on what we've done so far with Git and Github, I think I have a pretty good 
handle on the flow. Once we use them much more in-depth then I may need to read 
up more for example, we didn't revert to a certain commit and we didn't use a commit 
to track down on a certain change, etc. 

#### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I really enjoyed this first GPS as it gave me an opportunity to reinforce what 
I've learned. I was able to openly talk about my understanding of Git and Github
and if I was wrong about something then Traci and Charlotte were there to kindly 
correct me.
