## this is a way different change than the other two!

### *We were asked by Charlotte to skip the 2nd and 3rd paragraph of Release 4.*

#### Release 4 (2nd and 3rd paragraph):
Make a new branch, and make some changes to awesome_page.md. 
Show off some of your markdown GitHub flavored markdown (Links to an external site.) 
skills. Make something bold, italic, some sort of code block and a link (Links to an 
external site.). Also take a screenshot of you and your pair working on this challenge 
and display it inline. (You'll need to remember to upload it to the repository and 
link to it). Add and commit your changes for awesome_page.md, push your branch to GitHub.


Make a pull request like last time. The current navigator should review the diff of 
the request and merge it. You will be using this work flow all the time as a developer!
